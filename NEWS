dbox v0.0.3 (Release date: 2019-07-02)
=============

Changes:
* Omit missings at beginning of function; use completed cases only for all
  other processes.
* <normal> option plots an *idealized* normal distribution to +/- 3.1 std dev,
  rather than a simulated random normal distribution. Prevents non-normal
  distribution when n is small.
* Added option to specify variable name via <label> argument.
* Better parsing of variable name via sys.call() when <label> is not specififed.
* Include linetype in legend.
* <fill> option affects boxplot fill as well as density plot fill.


dbox v0.0.2 (Release date: 2019-06-29)
=============

Changes:
* Renamed package and main function to dbox.
* Switched to ggplot native stat_boxplot(), rather than combining several
  geom_segment() & annotate() into semi-manual boxplot. Yields a significant
  speed improvement.
* Switched to geom_path() rather than geom_stat() for density plots to get
  intial orientation the same as stat_boxplot().
* Now computes densities with n=512, rather than n=length(x). Yields a
  significant speed improvement.
